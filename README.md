# financial-calculations

The purpose of this repository is to hold some of my financial planning tools.
The tools listed here are for my own practice with python and aren't necessarily for any particular end user.

any feedback is welcomed and feel free to use the code contained in here for your own projects (none of the concepts or equations here are completely original though the code for them is).
